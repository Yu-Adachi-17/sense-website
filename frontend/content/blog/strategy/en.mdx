# Strategy

<Callout>Not just minutes — <strong>Strategy</strong> uses modern AI (ChatGPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) to turn discussion into next steps.</Callout>

## What it does
- **Boost**: what works and how to scale
- **Counter**: risks and how to fix
- **Top Issue**: the core question to solve
- **Thinking modes**: Logical / Critical / Lateral

## How to use (quick)
1) Generate minutes
2) Tap “Strategy”
3) Review Boost / Counter / Top Issue + 3 modes
4) Paste into your task system

## Sample (super short)
- Topic: “Solar Chill” (summer blend)
- Risk: 15% say “too sour”

**Boost:** pilot 10 stores; measure 7-day re-order  
**Counter:** add “mild sweet” option; A/B syrup level  
**Top Issue:** widen appeal without losing distinctiveness  
**Logical:** define segments → set KPIs → A/B → ship winner  
**Critical:** validate beyond social buzz with blind tests  
**Lateral:** extend to a scent/room-mist edition
