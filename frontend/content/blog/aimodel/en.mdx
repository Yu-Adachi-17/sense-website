# The AI models we use

We disclose the model policy behind our minutes so you know what powers your results.

## Why quality-first
Most products choose models by cost. We prioritize **clarity, actionability, and consistency** even if unit cost is higher.

## Adopted models (at the time of writing)
- **ChatGPT-5 (OpenAI)** — strong reasoning and tone control for decision-ready minutes.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google)** — long-context coherence and robust key-point extraction.
