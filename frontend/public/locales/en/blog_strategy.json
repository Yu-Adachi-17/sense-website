    "bullets": [
      "Boost — Positives & How to Amplify Them: Identifies what's working and suggests concrete ways to scale that success.",
      "Counter — Constructive Opposition & Improvements: Deliberately provides an opposing viewpoint or identifies risks, suggesting how to fix the underlying issues.",
      "Top Issue — The Core Problem: Pinpoints the single most important question or conflict from the meeting that needs to be solved.",
      "Logical Thinking — A structured, step-by-step solution for the Top Issue.",
      "Critical Thinking — Challenges the core assumptions, biases, and unasked questions behind the Top Issue.",
      "Lateral Thinking — A 'breakthrough' idea that leaps beyond the obvious, conventional solutions for the Top Issue."

Test 'Bloom Latte' online or via partnerships, not just in-store."
