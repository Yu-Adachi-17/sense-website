  },
  "lead": {
    "p1": "To our loyal Minutes.AI users: have you ever finished a meeting, hit 'Generate', and then stood there holding your phone, waiting for the text to appear so you could share it? It was a friction point we wanted to fix. With this update, we're removing that wait entirely."

  "feature": {
    "h2": "What is 'Automatic Email Delivery'?",
    "p1": "The concept is simple. You preset your recipients (like your team or manager) in the settings. Then, you simply record your meeting as usual.",
    "p2": "Previously, you had to keep the app open until the AI finished processing. Now, **you can close the app the second you stop recording.** The backend handles the heavy lifting and automatically emails the finished minutes to your chosen recipients the moment they are ready.",
    "note": "Note: This feature is currently rolling out for iOS (iPhone/iPad). Android users, stay tuned—we're working on it!"

        "p": "Meeting minutes only have value if they are shared. By automating this step, you ensure that participants and absentees receive the summary instantly, without you ever forgetting to hit 'Send'. It turns a manual chore into an automatic background process."
      },
      {
        "t": "2. Freedom from the 'Quality vs. Speed' Trade-off",
        "p": "Minutes.AI uses top-tier models like OpenAI Whisper, ChatGPT-5, and Gemini 3. High precision requires processing time—sometimes a few minutes for a long meeting. We know waiting is annoying. With this update, the processing time remains (to ensure quality), but **your waiting time drops to zero**. Put your phone in your pocket and move on to your next task."
