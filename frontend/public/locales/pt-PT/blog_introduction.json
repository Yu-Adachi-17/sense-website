      "full": "Alex (Marketing Lead): Thanks for joining, everyone — Jordan (E-commerce), Sam (Retail Ops), Taylor (PM), and Riley (Data). Let’s review last weekend’s smartwatch performance. Jordan, please start with online.\n\nJordan (E-commerce): Week-over-week, sessions are up 18%. Conversion improved from 2.9% to 3.2%. Revenue rose 12%. The spike mainly came from the influencer tie-in on Saturday; ad spend was up 6%.\n\nRiley (Data): CAC remains stable at around ¥2,400. However, retargeting CTR fell from 1.8% to 1.2%. I recommend a creative refresh and an A/B test with shorter headline copy. I can deliver a quick analysis deck by Friday (2025-10-17).\n\nAlex: Sounds good. Decision: Increase online ad budget by 15% for the next two weeks. Action: Jordan, launch the A/B test on the accessories hero copy by Wednesday (2025-10-15). Action: Riley, deliver the creative CTR analysis deck by Friday (2025-10-17).\n\nSam (Retail Ops): For physical stores, we had stockouts at Shibuya, Umeda, and Sapporo. A restock of 500 units is scheduled for Monday. Foot traffic dropped 4% due to the typhoon, but average basket value was flat.\n\nAlex: Decision: Proceed with the 500-unit restock across those three stores. Action: Sam, confirm supplier ETA and logistics by Tuesday (2025-10-14). Concern: lead-time risk if the supplier backlog grows.\n\nTaylor (PM): Firmware v1.2 fixes the battery drain issue and improves step-count calibration. Release notes are ready. I propose a launch on Oct 20 with a Q4 bundle — “Watch + Band” at ¥2,000 off. Support will need to publish an FAQ.\n\nAlex: Decision: Approve the Q4 bundle launch on 2025-10-20. Actions: Taylor, finalize the release schedule by Monday (2025-10-13). Support team, publish the FAQ by Thursday (2025-10-16). Marketing, prepare a Black Friday draft plan by Saturday (2025-10-25).\n\nAlex (closing message): Let’s spend smart and keep our pace clear and steady — clarity over speed. Commit to “who does what by when,” and keep meetings within 30 minutes."
