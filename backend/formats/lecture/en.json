Follow them strictly.\n\n            - **meetingTitle (String)**  \n              - Even if no explicit title is mentioned, provide a concise and appropriate one based on the content.  \n                Example: ‚ÄúStarbucks: Drink Preparation Operation Training‚Äù\n\n            - **attendees (Optional String)**  \n              - Include only if names of instructors or trainers are explicitly mentioned (audience names not needed).  \n                Omit the entire field if no names are mentioned.\n\n            - **date (String)**  \n              - Record the current timestamp from Date() as-is (e.g., \"2025-04-17 13:22\").\n\n            - **lectureObjectives (String)**  \n              - Clearly state the 'objectives or learning goals' of the lecture. If not mentioned, generate appropriately using NLP.\n\n            - **coreMessage (String)**  \n              - If there are any explicit statements at the end of the lecture indicating direction, vision, values, or motivational comments to the participants, record them.\n\n            - **topics (Array of Object)**  \n              - If multiple topics exist within the lecture, treat each as a separate object in the array.\n\n              - **topic (String)**  \n                - If a topic is explicitly named, use that as-is.  \n                - If not, create a concise title based on the content.\n\n              - **lectureProcedures (Array of Object)**  \n                - If procedures are divided into multiple sections, treat each as a separate object.  \n                - If section titles are not explicitly mentioned, create appropriate ones based on content.\n\n                - **steps (Array of Strings)**  \n                  - Document all steps comprehensively with a level of detail that allows reproducibility.  \n                  - Preserve the spoken order and structure them as numbered bullet points.\n\n                - **notes (Optional Array of Strings)**  \n                  - Extract and list any explicitly mentioned cautions or supplementary information related to the steps.  \n                  - Omit the field entirely if none exist.\n\n              - **lectureExamples (Optional Array of Strings)**  \n                - Extract any specific examples or episodes used to aid understanding.  \n                - Omit if none mentioned.\n\n              - **lectureDosAndDonts (Optional Object)**  \n                - Include only if there are explicit mentions of ‚Äúdos‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôts.‚Äù  \n                - Either or both may be included. Omit the entire object if neither is mentioned.\n\n              - **lectureTips (Optional Array of Strings)**  \n                - Extract any stated techniques, tips, or suggestions.  \n                - Omit if none mentioned.\n\n              - **highlightedStatements (Optional Array of Strings)**  \n                - Extract context-rich, particularly emphasized, or impressive key phrases.  \n                - Omit if none mentioned.\n\n            ---\n\n            ### üö© Important Extraction Guidelines\n\n            - Do **not** include speculation or subjective interpretation ‚Äî extract only what is **explicitly stated** in the transcript.\n            - If any field lacks applicable content, **omit** the entire field ‚Äî do **not** leave empty values.\n            - Always prioritize **reproducibility** and **operational usefulness** when extracting information.\n\n            ---",
